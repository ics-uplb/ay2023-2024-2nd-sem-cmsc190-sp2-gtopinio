# OSES Connect: A Centralized Attendance Management System for Ortiz-Saranay Elementary School
Authors: Mark Genesis C. Topinio and Mylah Rystie U. Anacleto

Ortiz-Saranay Elementary School (OSES) recognizes the importance of regular attendance for student development, academic performance, teacher accountability, and professionalism. However, the school currently relies on physical forms, which are labor-intensive and error-prone for attendance tracking. This study proposes a web-based attendance management system, OSES Connect, to address these challenges. The system will digitize the attendance process by using Quick Response codes. It will also enhance transparency by providing parents with email and SMS notifications about their children’s attendance. Additionally, OSES Connect will generate reports, replacing the manual use of physical forms, for more efficient management of attendance data. The system’s usability and effectiveness will be evaluated using the System Usability Scale.
