A low-cost web-based attendance management system, OSES Connect, was developed for Ortiz-Saranay Elementary School (OSES) to address the labor-intensive and error-prone nature of their existing physical form-based attendance tracking processes for students and teachers. The system digitized the attendance process using Quick Response (QR) codes and incorporated a Markov Chain model to predict absenteeism. OSES Connect improved parental monitoring by providing parents with email and Short Message Service (SMS) notifications about their children's attendance. Additionally, it generates comprehensive reports, augmenting the manual use of physical forms to manage attendance data efficiently. The system's usability and effectiveness were evaluated using the System Usability Scale, and it received an overall usability rating of 84.844 from 16 teacher respondents, indicating a high level of user satisfaction.
